There are three folder:
- One that would calculate the emissions emitted by planes (let's name it plane folder)
- One that would calculate the emissions emitted by train or a bus  (let's name it train folder)
- One that create the local website (let's name it website folder)

In the plane folder and the train folder, running only the master.py file would suffice. The other files shouldn't be touched unless you want to change something. There are two inputs for those two files to work: your google API, and the number of passengers that travel with the team. I have put for now 50, but this number should be refined.

For website folder, you need to run first get_excel_file.py and then run Building_a_website.py.

Once I have more time, I can go into more details about the differents files.

I'm so sorry for the variables names: it's a mix of english and french, and there is absolutely no logic why some are named in english and other in french...
