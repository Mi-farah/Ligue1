I want to build a website to highlight C02 emissions from traveling in the french Ligue 1 of football. 
I have 3 csvs as input that contains:
- co2 emissions for each travel: Plane, Train, Bus
- the actual trip (distance, time, comfort)
- the geographical positions of each club / stadium / airports
