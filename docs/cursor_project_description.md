# Ligue 1 Carbon Footprint Analysis & Visualization Project

## Project Overview
I am building a comprehensive web application to analyze and visualize the carbon emissions generated by travel in French Ligue 1 football. The project aims to highlight the environmental impact of different transportation methods used by teams and fans traveling between stadiums across France.

## Problem Statement
French Ligue 1 football teams and their supporters travel extensively throughout the season, generating significant carbon emissions. Currently, there's limited visibility into:
- The environmental impact of different travel modes (planes, trains, buses, cars)
- Comparative analysis of emissions between transportation methods
- The potential for reducing emissions through policy changes or travel restrictions

## Data Structure
The project works with three main datasets:

### 1. Plane Travel Emissions (`emission_carbone_match.csv`)
- **Structure**: Hosting team, Visiting team, Travel time (seconds), CO2 emissions (kg)
- **Coverage**: All possible team combinations (18 teams × 17 away games = 306 matches)
- **Sample data**: Angers → Auxerre: 2,271 seconds, 27,109 kg CO2

### 2. Train/Bus Travel Emissions (`emission_carbone_match.csv`)
- **Structure**: Hosting team, Visiting team, Travel time (seconds), Number of steps, CO2 emissions (kg)
- **Coverage**: Same 306 match combinations
- **Sample data**: Angers → Auxerre: 13,195 seconds, 2 steps, 267 kg CO2

### 3. Car Travel Data (`trajet_voiture.csv`)
- **Structure**: Route, Travel time, CO2 emissions
- **Coverage**: Alternative ground transportation option

## Key Features Required

### 1. Interactive Comparison Dashboard
- Side-by-side comparison of emissions for each match route
- Visual representation showing the dramatic difference between air travel (27,000+ kg CO2) vs train travel (200-2,000 kg CO2)
- Interactive filters by team, route, or transportation method

### 2. Team-Specific Analysis
- Total emissions per team for the entire season
- Ranking of teams by environmental impact
- Breakdown by home vs away travel patterns

### 3. Policy Impact Simulation
- Interactive tool to simulate travel restrictions (e.g., "No flights under 3 hours")
- Automatic routing to alternative transportation when restrictions apply
- Real-time calculation of emission reductions

### 4. Geographic Visualization
- Map showing all Ligue 1 stadiums and their locations
- Route visualization between stadiums
- Color-coded emissions overlay on map

## Technical Requirements

### Data Processing
- Flask-based web application (already partially implemented)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- CSV data integration from three calculation modules

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Data collection and calculation modules completed
- ✅ Basic Flask web framework established
- ✅ Core data processing functions implemented
- 🔄 Interactive visualizations need enhancement
- 🔄 User interface needs modernization
- 🔄 Policy simulation features need completion

## Business Value
This tool will serve multiple stakeholders:
- **Environmental organizations**: Quantify football's carbon footprint
- **League officials**: Make informed decisions about travel policies
- **Teams**: Understand their environmental impact and optimize travel
- **Fans**: Raise awareness about sustainable travel choices
- **Media**: Provide data-driven insights for reporting

## Success Metrics
- Clear visualization of 10-100x emission differences between transport modes
- Interactive policy simulation showing potential emission reductions
- User-friendly interface accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Real-time data updates as travel patterns change

## Next Steps for Website Development
1. Enhance the existing Flask application with modern UI/UX
2. Implement interactive Plotly dashboards
3. Add policy simulation functionality
4. Create responsive design for mobile/desktop access
5. Add data export capabilities for further analysis

This project combines environmental consciousness with sports analytics, providing a unique tool for understanding and reducing the carbon footprint of professional football in France.
